## TODO

======================

1. Transaction AWS Migration

2. After the transaction revamp is done build and ship to TestFlight

Where does the transaction AWS migration start ?

Well first that starts with building parallel Transactions Shit and stuff along those lines

Ok so first you're going to want to understand the shape to which the data needs to be before it gets
synchronized with the rest of them, also we have time to think of a better design, and place where they
can double click and learn more

I actually want to re-design this to be better it's not that helpful in any way.
